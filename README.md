# ABAP Cloud Development
# Acquire Core ABAP Skills – SAP Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of my practice code, notes, and hands-on examples while going through the [SAP Learning Journey: Acquire Core ABAP Skills](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/acquire-core-abap-skills).

The goal of this journey is to build a solid foundation in ABAP programming using Eclipse (ADT). I’m using this space to keep track of my progress and to have a reference for key topics.

## What's Covered

Here's a rough breakdown of what I've been learning and practicing:

- Basics of the ABAP language and working with the SAP system
- Declaring variables, using control structures, and writing clean code
- Working with internal tables, structures, and loop processing
- Modularizing code using Includes, Forms, Function Modules, and Classes
- Writing Classical Reports and exploring ALV Reports
- Using the ABAP Debugger effectively
- Accessing the database using Open SQL
- Writing and testing code in Eclipse (ADT)

## How I'm Using This Repo

Each `.abap` file in the `src` folder is tied to a topic or mini-exercise I’ve completed. Some are basic, some a bit more advanced as I progress.
